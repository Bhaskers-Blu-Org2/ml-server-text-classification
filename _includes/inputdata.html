This solution uses a preprocessed version of [NewsGroups20](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/twenty_newsgroups.html), containing a Subject, a Text, and a Label. It has a similar structure to a support ticket data set which would also have two data fields: Title, and Problem description. Thus, you can easily change this solution to use your support ticket data simply by providing the same structure for the test and train datasets.
